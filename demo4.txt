In physics (specifically in electromagnetism) the Lorentz force
(or electromagnetic force) is the combination of electric and magnetic force
on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. A particle of charge q
moving with a velocity v in an electric field E and a magnetic field B
experiences a force of

    F = q E + q v × B

(in SI units). It says that the electromagnetic force on a charge q
is a combination of a force in the direction of the electric field E
proportional to the magnitude of the field and the quantity of charge,
and a force at right angles to the magnetic field B and the velocity v of 
the charge, proportional to the magnitude of the field, the charge, and the 
velocity. Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on 
a current-carrying wire (sometimes called Laplace force), the
electromotive force in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field 
(an aspect of Faraday's law of induction), and the force on a moving 
charged particle.

Historians suggest that the law is implicit in a paper by James Clerk Maxwell, 
published in 1865. Hendrik Lorentz arrived at a complete derivation in 
1895, identifying the contribution of the electric force a few years 
after Oliver Heaviside correctly identified the contribution of the magnetic 
force.
