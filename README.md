# MsgStatCollecter

It's simple Python script to create diferents plots whit a (.txt) WhatsApp document. You can use your own WhatsApp (.txt) document, but there are some documents created to test the code.

The script only accepts two diferents time formats (those who have the two first demo documents). You can add those time formats in the function **firstdate** (line 259 in plots_functions.py).
